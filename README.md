# work-database-

I created this project to help clients keep track of what is going on in their company. 
Its a database that has three tables in it to help keep track of departments, roles, and employees. 
This is just an example of how the database can be used. 
The database can be used in many diffrent ways as long as you input the data you want to keep track of.
